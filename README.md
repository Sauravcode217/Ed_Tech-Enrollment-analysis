# Ed_Tech-Enrollment-analysis

my recent project analyzing the Stealth Edtech Startup by Raam Group enrollment dataset for kids' live online classes! Here's a snapshot of what we uncovered and recommended:



🔍 Key Insights:

🔹 Best Class Timings: Scheduling between 3 PM - 5 PM (PST) ensures maximum enrollment.

🔹 Target Age Group: Kids aged 8-13 are the most active participants.

🔹 Popular Classes: Courses like "Creative Writing 101" and "Onetime" classes lead in enrollments.

🔹 Marketing Success: Facebook is the top channel for driving sign-ups.

🔹 Preferred Days: Monday to Friday sees the highest attendance.

🔹 Top Teachers: Annalisa Ard and Aaron Potsick stand out with exceptional feedback and ratings.



📊 How It Was Done:

Used Excel for data cleaning and pivot tables, SQL for validation, and Power BI dashboards for visualization to derive actionable insights.

💡 Recommendations:

🔸 Focus on EST, MST, and CST time zones during the launch.

🔸 Expand presence in the US, Canada, and India.

🔸 Encourage "Onetime" and "Course" class formats for higher sales.

🔸 Promote star teachers and prioritize Gmail for communication.
